        <p>JP Lynch attends basketball practice three times a week, eats meals provided by University Athletics, receives free Under Armour gear, follows NCAA guidelines and knows the inside scoop on the plays for one of Notre Dame's highest ranked sports teams. No, he isn't a student athlete. He's not even a team manager. He's a member of the Notre Dame women's basketball scout team.</p>

        <p>John Paul "JP" Lynch is a senior finance and psychology student at the University of Notre Dame. Hailing from Mineola, New York, Lynch says he grew up "like every little kid does," playing as many sports as he could. When he reached fifth grade, though, he started focusing more on basketball. For most of his early basketball career, Lynch played as a shooting guard, but when he sprouted seven inches in two years, his role on the court changed.</p>

        <p>"My junior year of high school I was five foot ten, and by the end of senior year I was six foot five," Lynch explained. "I actually had to have surgery because my knees were kind of messed up, so I couldn't play my junior year."</p>

        <p>While recovering from surgery, Lynch served as his team's manager, where he first got a taste of the behind-the-scenes work that make athletics possible.</p>

    
         <p> "Being a manager for a year was a good learning experience. I definitely would have preferred to be on the court, but it made me more aware of all the other things that go into a sports team behind-the-scenes. I realized there's so much more than just players on a court. My senior year, when I was able to play again, I was so much more appreciative."</p>

        <p>Coming to Notre Dame, Lynch tried out for the men's club basketball team his sophomore year. That winter, he was recruited to join the women's scout team, and he's been a part of the practice squad ever since.</p>

        <p>Now, helping the women's basketball team prepare to play against upcoming opponents, Lynch has returned to his role behind the curtain. This time, though, his support doesn't come at the cost of being sidelined. Lynch's help comes by way of his playing. He practices as a stand-in for the team's upcoming opponents.</p>

        <p>Self-dubbed "the unpaid and the unknown," the women's basketball team's practice squad consists of eight players selected from men's club basketball to help prepare Notre Dame's varsity women's basketball team to play their opponents. Currently ranked No. 5 in the nation for men's collegiate club basketball — and standing much taller than most women's teams — men's club basketball offers a rich pool of talent for the women's team to practice against.</p>

        <p>Volunteering as a way to get closer to the sport they love, the practice squad scrimmages against the varsity women up to six times a week, mimicking playing styles of specific athletes on upcoming rival teams. Lynch, for example, was recruited to the squad his sophomore year in order to represent a 6'5" athlete the team would be playing in an upcoming matchup.</p>

        <p>"She was number 20, so they gave me a jersey with a 20 to wear. That weekend, I went over the plays she was involved in, trying to learn her style. She played left a lot, so in practice, I'd play left. For a week, I tried to become her."</p>

        <p>Since then, Lynch has "become" a full member of the practice squad, embodying a number of different players from week to week. Because he's so tall, Lynch tends to fill in as a center, but he adapts to wherever the team needs him most. One week he may be a post player who likes to shoot threes, shooting the ball right away when he gets it. Another, he might emulate a big passer, who tends to get rid of the ball and assist.</p>

        <p>"One of the coaches will show us a couple videos, highlighting three things that [the opponent] tends to do more often that they want us to do in practice. They may teach us a couple plays they do frequently or defensive strategies that they usually use in games. And we'll try to stay as close to that kind of structure as possible, so that the girls can get the best practice possible."</p>

        <p>Therein lies what makes Lynch's relationship to the team so interesting. Unlike most sports experiences, Lynch doesn't practice with the goal of competing. Of course, he wants the team to win their official games — after all, if they win a national championship, Lynch receives a ring too, he noted excitedly — but his practice is his end in and of itself. The plays run in practice are what he prepares for. His scrimmages are his "big games."</p>

        <div class="pullquote">
          "The purpose of our job is basically to play really well in practice in a way that they also improve. The better that we play — the harder we play defense, the harder that we play offense — the more accustomed they'll be to play against good players."
        </div>

        <p>Last year, with COVID restrictions nixing essentially all non-varsity sports, that opportunity to practice came as a luxury. As one of the few non-varsity athletes on campus who was able to participate in weekly sports, Lynch felt especially thankful for his women's basketball community, even if he had to be COVID-tested every other day.</p>

        <p>This year, with all the players vaccinated and mask mandates lifted, Lynch is excited to enjoy the community-aspect of the team, sharing post-practice meals or joining other practice players in the stands to see the women put their practice into play during the games.</p>

        <p>"It's interesting, because we're practicing against these girls three times a week. We know how they play; we cheer for them in games, but we never play on the same team as them. The women's basketball team is always the women's basketball team. So it's an interesting dynamic where we're always against them, but we also know we're ultimately rooting for them."</p>

        <p>Sometimes, though, that half-in half-out dynamic works out in the boys' favor. Lynch appreciates that, as a practice player, he's able to play as much as he wants to while still have the flexibility to create his own schedule as needed.</p>

        <p>Another perk of only being an unofficial member? Getting to play alongside the big leagues. When WNBA player and Notre Dame alumna Michaela Mabrey visited, for instance, she played with the boys on the practice team. If Olympian and former Irish player Jackie Young were to return, she'd play on the practice team.</p>

        <p>"It's really cool, because you don't get to play with the girls while they're here, but they come back after they've been out playing for real and they're on a whole other level.</p>

        <p>"And this time they're on our team."</p>
