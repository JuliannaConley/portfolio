        <p>A second grader in sparkly silver shoes twirled and twirled and twirled, her long, white tulle dress fanning out around her while she and her partner, a boy wearing head-to-toe green except for a white bandana, danced the merengue to Oro Solido's "La Tanga." As the music ended, she and 16 other Bronzeville students representing the Dominican Republic threw their arms up triumphantly before taking a bow.</p>

        <p>Meanwhile, outside the Beasley Academic Center theater, in neighborhoods across Chicago, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers patrolled the city, looking for immigrants lacking permanent legal status.</p>

<p>Beasley observed Hispanic Heritage Month in a school assembly on Friday, performing songs from Mexico, Cuba and Puerto Rico, as well as the Dominican Republic. Despite immigrant raids across Chicago and President Trump's Executive Orders to remove diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, the assembly was just one of many Bronzeville and Bridgeport school events celebrating Hispanic culture.</p>

        <p>Minnie Miñoso Academy in Bridgeport kicked off the month with spirit week dress-up days and ended in October with food and dancing. Horizon Science Academy - McKinley Park hosted an all-ages Familia Block Party after school. Bronzeville's De La Salle Institute's Spanish Honors Society planned trivia questions for schoolwide announcements and salsa cook-offs at lunch. They ended the month with a performance that began with audience members emerging from the crowd to signify Latinos are everywhere, according to Maria Maldonado, the AP Spanish teacher.</p>

        <p>These celebrations coincided with the first month of the Department of Homeland Security's Operation Midway Blitz, during which its agents arrested more than 1,000 immigrants in Illinois, according to its reports. The majority of immigrants lacking permanent legal status come from Latin American countries, according to migration think tanks.</p>

        <p>Predominantly Hispanic schools such as Bridgeport's Evergreen Academy have long encouraged students to embrace their culture, according to teachers, but this year, school leaders felt it especially important to commemorate the month.</p>

        <div class="pullquote">
          "We're not going to let anyone take away our culture. We wanted to remind our students that it is ok, especially in this climate, to be who they are and to be proud of the person that they are."
        </div>

        <p>Evergreen planned its first full-day Hispanic Heritage Month celebration this year. For seven hours, students participated in cultural activities such as making piñatas, learning traditional dances and solving clues to a scavenger hunt that spelled out "familia."</p>

        <p>According to school leaders, non-Hispanic students were just as excited to learn about the customs as Hispanic students were.</p>

        <p>"You don't have to be of a certain culture to celebrate," Guerrero-Diaz said. "We did a (dress-up) day of 'Monarcas and Migrants,' reminding students we are all descendants of immigrants, whether we are first-generation or fifth-generation."</p>

        <p>At Beasley, where the school's predominantly Black population shook tambourines and danced las chiapanecas on Friday, Spanish teacher Karen Damian shared that goal of highlighting Hispanic culture's relevance in non-Hispanic students' lives.</p>

        <p>"Thinking beyond our own neighborhoods, beyond our own school community, thinking through a worldwide lens, the purpose was just to value diversity and really go beyond stereotypes," Damian said.</p>

        <p>And for Charlene Williams – a fourth grade Beasley parent and Kenyan immigrant whose sons were scared their mother would be deported after hearing about local immigrant arrests – that emphasis on diversity was essential.</p>

        <p>Williams said the Blitz "hit closer to home," because the racial profiling used to identify immigrants reminded her sons of the discrimination they learned about in Black history.</p>

        <p>"I'm glad the schools are doing something to celebrate these cultures," Williams said. "It's important kids learn to treat everyone with dignity and respect."</p>
